# Definitions of features
  utter_sarcasm_definition:
    - text: "A comment is sarcastic when the content is ironic, that is, when the writer uses words
    that mean the opposite of what he really wants to say and when it is accompanied by a harsh,
    sharp and negative criticism and made in bad faith. \ \n"


  utter_mockery_definition:
    - text: "This category indicates that the comment ridicules, humiliates or mocks a person or group."

  utter_insult_definition:
    - text: "This category indicates that the comment contains one or more
    explicit insults or slurs with the intention to offend a person or group.
    This attribute correlates with the improper language category, which means that if the comment contains insults,
    it is also annotated as improper language, but not the other way around (i.e. improper language does not necessarily imply insults or slurs)."


  utter_improper_language_definition:
    - text: "The category Improper language indicates
    that the comment contains language not consider to be proper or that
    is vulgar and impolite and/or which includes rude words.
    However, we may find comments that include insults or improper language used
    with a humoristic or positive intentionality."

  utter_aggressiveness_definition:
    - text: "A comment contains aggressive language when it expresses
  violence or a desire to exercise it in a deliberate and conscious or unconscious way, without necessarily including sarcasm,
  mockery or insults. This aggressiveness can be expressed in a passive manner,
  by justifying or empathizing with an aggressive action, or in an active way, by promoting and encouraging or inciting violence"

  utter_stereotype_definition:
    - text: "Stereotypes are defined as beliefs and ideas widely attributed to a group,
  by which the individuals in this group are characterised in an undifferentiated and simplified way based on
  the magnification or exaggeration of an individual characteristic (race, ethnicity, religion, gender,
  sexual orientation and age, among others)"
